                        Big Five personality characteristics represent the most widely used model for generally describing how a person engages with the world. The model includes five primary dimensions:
                        <ul>
                            <li><span className="bold">Agreeableness</span> is a person's tendency to be compassionate and cooperative toward others.</li>
                            <li><span className="bold">Conscientiousness</span> is a person's tendency to act in an organized or thoughtful way.</li>
                            <li><span className="bold">Extraversion</span> is a person's tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others.</li>
                            <li><span className="bold">Emotional range</span>, also referred to as Neuroticism or Natural reactions, is the extent to which a person's emotions are sensitive to the person's environment.</li>
                            <li><span className="bold">Openness</span> is the extent to which a person is open to experiencing different activities.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Each of these top-level dimensions has six facets that further characterize an individual according to the dimension.
                        
                        Needs describe which aspects of a product resonate with a person. The model includes twelve characteristic needs.
